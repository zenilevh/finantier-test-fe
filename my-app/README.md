### Overview
i build this website using reactjs and few library
first i using command to create React App
```json
npx create-react-app my-app
```
and install some library
after that run the program using

```json
npm start
```
before start the program, remember to install all dependencies first using "npm install"

for deploying this app, i only need firebase to deployment since its free and reliable.
but for more commercial and more scalable i suggest using AWS(Amazon Web Service)

### Challenge part
well the most challenging part itself is the market stock,because i need to understand first how the market stock works, how to get variation and what its ask, bid the previous close, and how to the chart works with market stock data, what i need to fetch on a market stock chart. but after i understand a little about the market stock and what API should i use, the challenging part becomes more easier, and estimated 1 day i can finish this assignment if i understand about how it works
